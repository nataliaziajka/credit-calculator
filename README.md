# Project Title

Credit Calculator

## Description

A simple application in Spring, using forms for calculating creditworthiness. The interested person provides: monthly earnings, how much credit he wants and how many months he wants a loan. Then, we divide the amount of the loan over the loan period and check whether the amount is greater than the monthly earnings of the deliverer. If it is in place of the form, we display a big nice green message about the loan, otherwise the form does not disappear, and above it a message appears that the loan has not been allocated and you should try with a longer period of credit.
